Dear Friends,
	
	I am pleased to announce the release and availability of

	Kscd 0.3 -- A simple CD Player for the KDE Project

This new release of Kscd is a complete rewrite of Yat-Nam Lo's kscd
version 0.2. The only thing that remained somewhat untouched was the
general front-panel look of kscd. The most notable technical change is
that kscd is no longer based on workbone. I have given it a new engine
taken from workman and added many improvements. Due to the workman
engine, Kscd should compile and work properly on a variety of
different platforms and cdrom drives. Unfortunately this has also
complicated the compilation and installation procedure a bit. Having
introduced a number of changes to the workman sources, Kscd is now on
under IDE Linux cdrom setup a faster, more responsive player than any
other player I know of under Unix and Windows 95. (Incidentally, Kscd
is the first player under Unix which doesn't hang my cd on
exit). While kscd does not yet offer all the bells and whistles that a
cd player such as xmcd offers it is at 80000 bytes definitely a lean
mean cd-machine. ( Compare this to the 1 meg statically linked slow
dog xmcd ). While I don't like xmcd for its slowness and size, xmcd
has invented the cddb database format and the cddb internet CD
databases. Internet cddb is the coolest thing ever invented for
cd-players and I am currently working on implementing cddb support for
kscd.  Watch out for the next release.

Changes:
( Too numerous to even try to mention, among those:)

	o New engine (Workman)
	  that is support for: Linux (SCSI and IDE), Sun, FreeBSD, 
	  NetBSD, Ultrix, HPUX, SONY NEWS, SVR4, SOLARIS
	o Support for sbpcd and mcdx 
	o Real LED, ( This has probably to go in the future, since
          cddb support will take up space in the display panel )
	o Looping, Random Play
	o Configuration Dialog
	o Kscd is now a KApplication supporting ColorSchemes etc.

Have fun with kscd!
