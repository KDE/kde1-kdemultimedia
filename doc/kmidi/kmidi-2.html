<H2><A NAME="ss2.1">2.1 How to obtain KMidi</A></H2>

<P>KMidi is part  of the KDE project 
<A HREF="http://www.kde.org">http://www.kde.org</A>.
KMidi can be found on 
<A HREF="ftp://ftp.kde.org/pub/kde/">ftp://ftp.kde.org/pub/kde/</A>, the main ftp site
of the KDE project. It's home site is

<H2><A NAME="ss2.2">2.2 Requirements</A></H2>

<P>In order to successfully compile KMidi, you need the latest versions of <CODE> libkdecore</CODE>
and <CODE> libkdeui</CODE>. All required libraries as well as KMidi itself can be found
on 
<A HREF="ftp://ftp.kde.org/pub/kde/">ftp://ftp.kde.org/pub/kde/</A>. </P>





<H2><A NAME="ss2.3">2.3 Compilation and installation</A></H2>


<P>If you have Timidity already installed be sure to back up your configuration file
since by default KMidi will overwrite them!</P>

<P>
<A HREF="mailto:goemon@anime.net">Dan Hollis</A>
has put together a patch set. Please visit his page at,
<A HREF="http://www.anime.net/~goemon/timidity/">http://www.anime.net/~goemon/timidity</A> and help him make this the best set available.</P>

<P>Patches can also be found packaged as dep or rpm modules on the Sunsite
archives:</P>

<P>I have not tried the above (yet), and personally use the Midia patch set together
with a few additional patches and a couple of additional drum sets.</P>
<P>The Midia patch set can be found at:
<A HREF="ftp://archive.cs.umbc.edu/pub/midia/">ftp://archive.cs.umbc.edu/pub/midia/</A></P>
<P>For additional patches and drum sets: (get the gsdrum and wow patches)
<A HREF="ftp://ftp.cdrom.com/pub/gus/sound/patches/files/">ftp://ftp.cdrom.com/pub/gus/sound/patches/files/</A></P>
<P>Vincent Pagel has put together a collection of patches. This link
can only be reached during night hours (Paris).
<A HREF="ftp://sig.enst.fr/pub/midi/instruments/">ftp://sig.enst.fr/pub/midi/instruments/</A></P>
<P>The config file that goes with his patch set can be found here:
<A HREF="ftp://sig.enst.fr/pub/midi/timidity_pagel.cfg">ftp://sig.enst.fr/pub/midi/timidity_pagel.cfg</A></P>

<P>Also check the TimidityPage:

<P>and Takahis's Page:

<H3>Patch set installation</H3>


<P>Each of the above patch sets ( you need only one) should come with a .cfg
configuration file similar to the .cfg files which come with KMidi 
and reside in /usr/local/lib/timdity  </P>

<P>KMidi has configurations files ready made for you for a number
of common patch sets, such as the media patch set. </P>
<P>In order to complete the installation of a complete patch set 
edit timidity.cfg and source the appropriate config files for the patch 
set/sets you downloaded. ( If you have a look at timidity.cfg it
will be totally obvious what I am talking about)</P>
<P>That's it. Now you can go head an play the other midis that are in the 
KMidi distribution ( and any others of course)</P>


<H3>Miscelaneous</H3>

<P>Ocassionally you will see that K Midi can't find a patch for 
a particular instrument. ( Open the Info Window in order to
see this information ) In that case, all you have to do 
is go out and get yourself the missing patch and install
it by moving the patch into the /patch directory and editing
your patch set .cf file to tell KMidi that the new patch
is available now. </P>

<P>Sometimes a particular instrument doesn't sound all that well. 
In that case, simply go out and get yourself a different patch from any of the
Ultrasound archives and replace the not so optimal patch by a
better one. As you can see, it is totally up to you how good
every instrument will sound. You can even make your own patches
with the pat2wav utility which is included in the KMidi distribution.</P>
