<P><H2>What's KMid ?</H2></P>
<P>KMid is a midi/karaoke player, that uses /dev/sequencer to play a midi file
through an external synth, GUS , AWE and FM cards . 
 At the same time that the song is played, lyrics are displayed in a beautiful
 window so that the user can sing or just follow the letter :-).
</P>
<P><H2>Features</H2></P>
<P>
<LI>KMid has a nice interface to display karaoke text
<LI>Powerful Midi Mapper that will make people with no general midi
synths happier than ever :-).
<LI>Drag & drop so you can drop in KMid any midi file from a kfm window.
<LI>Customizable fonts for karaoke text to be displayed.
<LI>Supports the two standards to introduce lyrics in midi files, that is, lyrics or text events (and guess which one a song uses automatically)
<LI>Session Management. If a song is playing while you logout from KDE, the next
time you login, the same song will start playing !
<LI>Can play some broken midi files which make other players core dump !
<LI>Can open gzipped files just as any other midi file.
<LI>Consumes approximately 0.1% of my CPU (depends on the complexity of
the song)
<LI>Supports external midi synths, AWE , FM and GUS cards (for the latter needs the Linux Ultrasound Project driver and gusd installed).
<LI>Runs on Linux and FreeBSD (perhaps also other unices ...)
</P>
<P><H2>How can I open a song?</H2></P>
<P>You can open a song by pressing File | Open ... , or by dragging the file
 from a kfm window and dropping it in the kmid window. You can also pass a
 song to kmid in the command line. There's yet another way to open a file,
 it is by selecting it from the currently selected collection, that is,
 from the combo box under the time bar.
<BR>
Hey that's easy, let's go to more difficult questions ! :-) ...</P>
<P><H2>How do I start playing a song?</H2></P>
<P>You have three ways to start playing a song, by selecting it from the menu in
Song|Play , by clicking on the play button of the toolbar, or by pressing the
Space key of the keyboard. Songs will automatically start playing if you
drop it in KMid's window</P>
<P><H2>What's all that about text and lyrics events ?</H2></P>
<P>There are two methods to store lyrics in a song, by using "Text events"
or "lyrics events", some songs use the first, some the second, some use both
of them, and some  don't include lyrics :-) . KMid lets you choose which events
to display, and even better, it has an option to automagically select the type of
events that a song uses, so that you don't have to change the type manually.
</P>
<P><H2>How do I play a song from a specified second?</H2></P>
<P>
Start playing the song and then press with the middle button of your mouse
on the slider
</P>
<P><H2>Where can I download more karaoke songs from?</H2></P>
<P>
Just ask me if you are interested :-)
</P>
<P><H2>What's a collection ?, How do I use them ?</H2></P>
<P>
A collection is a list of midi files that you put in a set, and which
 are played sequencially . You can create new collections from the organize
 collections dialog, which you can open by selecting "Collections | Organize..."
 in the menu.
<BR>To create a new collection click on the "New" button and enter the name you
want it to have. To remove a collection just select it and press on the
"Delete" button. There is a collection that you cannot delete, it's the
Temporary collection, which holds songs you want to hear without adding them
to any of the other collections.
<BR>You can select a song to play of the current collection from the combo
 box under the time bar, or from the organize dialog. To change the current
 collection, select it from the dialog.
<BR>Keep in mind that the Temporary Collection contents are not saved to disk,
so if you want to save it, you should click on the "Copy" button to copy
it to another name.
</P>
<P><H2>How do I add songs to a collection?<BR>What's autoAdd ?</H2></P>
<P>To add a song to a collection, just open the organize dialog, select the
 collection and click on the "Add" button, then select the file you want
 to add.
<BR>There is another method, if you turn on the "autoAdd to collection" option
from the "Collections" menu, every song you open or drop to kmid, will be
automatically added to the collection.
<BR>If you don't want this to happen, turn it off, and then, when you open
a song, the current collection will be set to the Temporary Collection, and
the opened song added to it.
</P>
<P><H2>My AWE card doesn't generate any sound</H2></P>
<P>
If you have installed kmid from a binary package, awe support may not
 be built into the kmid binaries, so you should download the sources and
 compile them. If you have already done that, then it may be a bug :-), so
 mail me.
</P>
<P><H2>What's a Midi Mapper?</H2></P>
<P>
If you have a synthesizer that doesn't complain with the General Midi
 standard, and you play a midi file with it, you will hear a piano playing
 the track that should be played by a flute and a drum playing the track
 that should be played by a piano. So you need some method to map sounds
 to different ones, this is what a Midi Mapper does. You can specify what
 values have to be passed to your synth so that it emulates a GM synth.
</P>
<P><H2>How can I use a mapper with my synthesizer?</H2></P>
<P>
There isn't a graphical tool to configure it (yet) so you should
edit the map file by hand :-(.
<BR>Once you have done a map, select Options | Midi Setup ... and press on the
Browse button to select the map file you have created.  
<BR>Another method is to add two lines like these to 
 ~/.kde/share/config/kmidrc :
<BR>[Midimapper]
<BR>Loadfile=**absolute path to map file** 
</P>
<P>
So if you, like me, have a Yamaha PSS790 you are of luck, just use the
 included file . But if you have a different synthesizer that isn't General
 Midi compliant, then you will have to make your own mapper
</P>
<P>
To do so, you should copy the file yamaha790.map to work on it without
 changing the original . Suppose that it is mysynth.map (though it
 should be "model of your synth".map) . Then you should edit the kmidrc
 file as above, pointing Loadfile to this copy on which you will work.
 Now you are ready to start.</P>
<P>... but I'm not, this version is not finished so I don't think that
 anybody will notice a small lack of help ;-) So please, follow your instinct
 and if you have any question, send it to me at : antlarr@arrakis.es
</P>
<P>
And remember three things :
<BR>1.- You should encourage the author to continue working on kmid,
because he has better things to do than programming kmid if nobody uses
it :-)
<BR>2.- You can download the latest version at :
<BR>http://www.arrakis.es/~rlarrosa/kmid.html</P>
<BR>3.- Please send me a postcard from where you live to :
<BR>
<BR>Antonio Larrosa Jimenez
<BR>Rio Arnoya. 10 5B
<BR>29006 Malaga 
<BR>(Spain)
<BR> This would keep me happy and you will also enter in the postcard senders
of the PEOPLE file (currently empty)
