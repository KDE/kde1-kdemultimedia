<sect>Introduction

<p>
This new release of Kscd is a complete rewrite of Yat-Nam Lo's kscd
version 0.2. 
<p>
The most notable technical change is
that kscd is no longer based on workbone. I have given it a new engine
taken from the <url url="http://www.midwinter.com/workman/index.html"
name="workman">
a well known cd player for various Unix platforms  written by 
<url url="mailto:koreth@midwinter.com" name="Stephen Grimm">.

Due to the workman engine, Kscd 0.3 in contrast to Kscd 0.2 should compile and 
work properly on a variety of
different Unix platforms. Unfortunately this has also
complicated the compilation and installation procedure a bit. 

Having introduced a number of changes to the workman sources, Kscd is now on
for the most common platform, a Linux IDE cdrom, a faster, more 
responsive player than any other player I know of under Unix and Windows 95. 
Incidentally, Kscd is also the first player under Unix which doesn't hang my 
personal cdrom drive on exit. 

While kscd does not yet offer all the bells and whistles that a
cd player such as xmcd offers it is at about 80000 bytes definitely a lean
mean cd-machine. Compare this to the  1 meg statically linked slow
motif dog xmcd. 

Nevertheless, while xmcd is big and slow, it 
has invented the cddb database format and the cddb internet CD
databases. Internet cddb is in my opinion a fantastic concept 
and I am currently working on implementing cddb support for
kscd.  Watch out for the next release.

<bf/BTW:/ Kscd stands for "The KDE Project's small/simply CD player".


<p>
I hope you will enjoy this cd-player,

<sect>Installation
<p>
<sect1>How to obtain Kscd
<p>
Kscd is an application for the KDE project <url url="http://www.kde.org">.
Kscd can be found on <url url="ftp://ftp.kde.org/pub/kde/">, the main ftp site
of the KDE project.

<sect1>Requirements
<p>
In order to successfully compile Kscd, you need the latest versions of <tt> libkdecore</tt>
and <tt> libkdeui</tt>. All required libraries as well as Kscd itself can be found
on <url url="ftp://ftp.kde.org/pub/kde/">. 



<sect1>Compilation and installation
<p>

In order to compile and install Kscd on your system, type the following in the base 
directory of the Kscd distribution:
<tscreen><verb>
% ./configure
</verb></tscreen>

NOW YOU MUST CHECK THE FIRST FEW LINES OF THE plat_xxx.c FILE CORRESPONDING
TO YOUR PLATFORM AND MAKE THE NECESSARY CHANGES.<p>

I apologize for the inconvenience, but a cdrom player is a device driver
of sorts and it very hard if not impossible to find out what sort of 
hardware you have. I hope to be able to provide an interactive installation
script in the near future.<p>

I have made changes to the original workman cd placer source 
code that made kscd the fastest, most responsive and quietest cd-player
for an average Linux IDE cdrom drive. I hope you will find this to hold
true for your particular hardware too. In the unlikely case that my changes do
not work for your particular hardware setup, setting the proper defines will
disable those changes and revert to the original workman behavior.
<p>
I have also  added code from <url url="milliByte@DeathsDoor.com" 
name="Dirk Foersterling">
which should give you better playing if you use the sbpcd or mcdx drivers under
Linux. You must however explicitely enable this by defining the appropriate
defines in plat_linux.c.<p>

If you are experiencing trouble getting kscd to work on a non-Linux platform
please study the original Workman documentation in the docs directory of
the kscd distribution. They contain quite a bit of information and may prove to 
be very helpful. The original makefiles are in the makefiles subdirectory
and should also be of interest in case of trouble. <p>

<p>
Please inform me of any modification you had to undertake to the current 
distribution in  order to get things to work on your platform. I will then 
include those changes in future versions of kscd.

<p>
<tscreen><verb>
% make
% make install
</verb></tscreen>

<bf/Again:/ Should you run into problems, please report them to me. 

<sect>Onscreen Fundamentals
<p>

Sorry, not written yet. I am sure however that you will have no trouble operating
Kscd.
