<P><A NAME="3."></A><H1>3. Collections</H1></P>
<P>
A collection is a list of midi files that you put in a set, and which
 are played one after another . This section will help you to use them, and
 will give you some useful tips to make a good use of them .
</P>
<P><A NAME="3.1."></A><H2>3.1. Creating collections</H2></P>
<P>
To create a collection, first open the 'Collection Manager' dialog, by 
 selecting the 'Organize ...' entry of the 'Collections' menu .
 Then click on the 'New' button, and enter the name you want the collection
 to have .
<BR>You can also copy a complete collection by selecting it and then pressing
 the 'Copy' button, which will ask you for the name of the new collection
 that will have initially the same songs as the selected collection .
<BR>Once you have more than one collection, you can change the active
 collection from the 'Collection Manager', by selecting it .
</P>
<P><A NAME="3.2."></A><H2>3.2. The Temporary Collection</H2></P>
<P>
The Temporary Collection is a collection that is used to hold songs you want
 to play but that you don't want to add to any collection .
<BR> This collection is NOT SAVED on exit of the application, so keep it in
 mind when you add lots of songs to it.
<BR>Keep on reading this section for a better understanding of the
 Temporary Collection.
</P>
<P><A NAME="3.3."></A><H2>3.3. Adding songs to collections (how to use 'AutoAdd')</H2></P>
<P>
There are some different ways to add a song to a collection.
<BR>First of all in each method, you must have selected the collection you
 want to add songs to in the 'Collection Manager'.
<BR>Then you can press on the 'Add' button to add a song, there will appear
 an open file dialog so that you can choose which song to add.
<BR>The other methods to add a song depend on the state of the AutoAdd option.
<BR>If 'AutoAdd' is active, when you open a song (using 'File | Open ...' or
 drag & drop) it (they) will be added to the active collection without
 user intervention . If 'AutoAdd' is not active, when you open a song the
 Temporary Collection will be activated and cleared, and the opened songs
 will be added to it.
</P>
<P><A NAME="3.4."></A><H2>3.4. Removing songs from collections</H2></P>
<P>
To delete a song from a collection, just open the 'Collection Manager',
 select the appropiate collection, and the song you wish to delete, and then
 click on the 'Remove' button.
</P>
<P><A NAME="3.5."></A><H2>3.5. Playing in order or at random</H2></P>
<P>
You can select the order in which songs will be played . When you select
 'In order mode' from the 'Collections' menu, songs will be played in the
 same order in which they were added to the collection . When you select
 'Shuffle mode', KMid will generate a random variable with a discrete
 uniform distribution to really play randomly the songs in the collection
 . It will give values to that random variable while generating the list
 in which order the songs will be played (you surely want to play random
 songs, but don't wwant to play twice the same song, and you want to play the
 last played song when you press on the 'Previous Song' button, don't
 you ? :-) ) .
<BR>The random list in which the collection will be played will be
 regenerated each time you add or remove a file in the active collection,
 or when you press on the 'Shuffle mode' entry of the menu .

<P><A NAME="3.6."></A><H2>3.6. Selecting a song from a collection</H2></P>
<P>
You can select a song to play in the 'Collection Manager', or by
 using the combo box over the karaoke text.
<BR>You can also change to the next song by using the 'Next Song' entry of
 the 'Song' menu, the 'Next Song' button of the toolbar, or pressing
 on the right arrow.
<BR>To change to the previous song, use the 'Previous Song' entry of
 the 'Song' menu, the 'Previous Song' button of the toolbar, or press

<P><A NAME="3.7."></A><H2>3.7. Deleting collections</H2></P>
<P>
