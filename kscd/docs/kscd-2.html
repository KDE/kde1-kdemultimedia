<H2><A NAME="ss2.1">2.1 How to obtain Kscd</A></H2>

<P>Kscd is an application for the KDE project 
<A HREF="http://www.kde.org">http://www.kde.org</A>.
Kscd can be found on 
<A HREF="ftp://ftp.kde.org/pub/kde/">ftp://ftp.kde.org/pub/kde/</A>, the main ftp site
of the KDE project.</P>


<H2><A NAME="ss2.2">2.2 Requirements</A></H2>

<P>In order to successfully compile Kscd, you need the latest versions of <CODE> libkdecore</CODE>
and <CODE> libkdeui</CODE>. All required libraries as well as Kscd itself can be found
on 
<A HREF="ftp://ftp.kde.org/pub/kde/">ftp://ftp.kde.org/pub/kde/</A>. </P>




<H2><A NAME="ss2.3">2.3 Compilation and installation</A></H2>


<P>In order to compile and install Kscd on your system, type the following in the base 
directory of the Kscd distribution:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
% ./configure
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>NOW YOU MUST CHECK THE FIRST FEW LINES OF THE plat_xxx.c FILE CORRESPONDING
TO YOUR PLATFORM AND MAKE THE NECESSARY CHANGES.</P>

<P>I apologize for the inconvenience, but a cdrom player is a device driver
of sorts and it very hard if not impossible to find out what sort of 
hardware you have. I hope to be able to provide an interactive installation
script in the near future.</P>

<P>I have made changes to the original workman cd placer source 
code that made kscd the fastest, most responsive and quietest cd-player
for an average Linux IDE cdrom drive. I hope you will find this to hold
true for your particular hardware too. In the unlikely case that my changes do
not work for your particular hardware setup, setting the proper defines will
disable those changes and revert to the original workman behavior.</P>
<P>I have also  added code from 
<A HREF="milliByte@DeathsDoor.com">Dirk Foersterling</A>
which should give you better playing if you use the sbpcd or mcdx drivers under
Linux. You must however explicitely enable this by defining the appropriate
defines in plat_linux.c.</P>

<P>If you are experiencing trouble getting kscd to work on a non-Linux platform
please study the original Workman documentation in the docs directory of
the kscd distribution. They contain quite a bit of information and may prove to 
be very helpful. The original makefiles are in the makefiles subdirectory
and should also be of interest in case of trouble. </P>


<P>Please inform me of any modification you had to undertake to the current 
distribution in  order to get things to work on your platform. I will then 
include those changes in future versions of kscd.</P>
