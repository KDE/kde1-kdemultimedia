<P>
This section describes the usage of the most used functions of KMid
</P>

<P><A NAME="2.1."></A><H2>2.1. Opening songs</H2></P>
<P>
You can open a song by some different ways. First, you can select 'Open...' from
 the 'File' menu, then you are presented with a standard open dialog, with which
 you can select the song you wish to open.
<BR>You can drag a file from a KFM window and drop it in the KMid window .
 You can also drag & drop multiple songs at the same time .
<BR>If you specify a song in the command line when running KMid, it will
also be opened .
<BR>And the last way is by selecting the song from the list of songs
of the active collecion .
</P>
<P><A NAME="2.2."></A><H2>2.2. Playing songs</H2></P>
<P>
To play a song, first open it, and then press on the Play button of the toolbar
, or the 'Play' entry of the 'Song' menu, or just press the Space key .
 Note that when you open a file using drag & drop, KMid will start playing it
 automatically (if you drop more than 1 file, they will be added to a collection
 and they will be played sequencially) .
<BR>Once KMid is playing a song, you can move the time slider, by pressing
with the middle mouse button, to play from a specified second.
<BR>The Space key is used for two things, when music is playing, and you
press the Space key, it will act as when you press on the pause button or
the 'Pause' entry of the 'Song' menu, that is, it will pause music .
 If you press the Space key when no music is being played, it will play it.
</P>

<P><A NAME="2.3."></A><H2>2.3. Seeing lyrics</H2></P>
<P>
There are two methods to store lyrics in a song, by using "Text events"
or "Lyrics events", some songs use the first, some the second, some use both
of them, and some  don't include lyrics :-) . KMid lets you choose which events
to display, and even better, it has an option to automagically select the type of
events that a song uses, so that you don't have to change the type manually .
That way, if you activate the 'Automatic Text chooser' entry of the 'Options' menu
 the karaoke text will be automatically selected, but you can still change
 them if you preffer to see the other type .
<BR>To select which type to see, you can use the appropiate entries of the
'Options' menu, or just press the '1' and '2' keys of your keyboard to
see the "Text events" or "Lyrics events" .
