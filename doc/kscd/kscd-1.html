<P>This new release of Kscd is a complete rewrite of Yat-Nam Lo's kscd
version 0.2. </P>
<P>The most notable technical change is
that kscd is no longer based on workbone. I have given it a new engine
taken from the 
<A HREF="http://www.midwinter.com/workman/index.html">workman</A>
a well known cd player for various Unix platforms  written by 
<A HREF="mailto:koreth@midwinter.com">Stephen Grimm</A>.</P>
<P>Due to the workman engine, Kscd 0.3 in contrast to Kscd 0.2 should compile and 
work properly on a variety of
different Unix platforms. Unfortunately this has also
complicated the compilation and installation procedure a bit. </P>
<P>Having introduced a number of changes to the workman sources, Kscd is now on
for the most common platform, a Linux IDE cdrom, a faster, more 
responsive player than any other player I know of under Unix and Windows 95. 
Incidentally, Kscd is also the first player under Unix which doesn't hang my 
personal cdrom drive on exit. </P>
<P>While kscd does not yet offer all the bells and whistles that a
cd player such as xmcd offers it is at about 80000 bytes definitely a lean
mean cd-machine. Compare this to the  1 meg statically linked slow
motif dog xmcd. </P>
<P>Nevertheless, while xmcd is big and slow, it 
has invented the cddb database format and the cddb internet CD
databases. Internet cddb is in my opinion a fantastic concept 
and I am currently working on implementing cddb support for
kscd.  Watch out for the next release.</P>
<P><B>BTW:</B> Kscd stand for "The KDE Project's small/simply CD player".</P>


<P>I hope you will enjoy this cd-player,</P>
