<P>Version 0.4:
<P>Kscd now features a new installation script. Support for Irix and Sun/Solaris
cdda was added.
<P>Version 0.3:
<P>The most notable technical change is
that kscd is no longer based on workbone. I have given it a new engine
taken from the 
<A HREF="http://www.midwinter.com/workman/index.html">workman</A>
a well known cd player for various Unix platforms  written by 
<A HREF="mailto:koreth@midwinter.com">Stephen Grimm</A>.
<P>Due to the workman engine, Kscd 0.3 in contrast to Kscd 0.2 should compile and 
work properly on a variety of
different Unix platforms. Unfortunately this has also
complicated the compilation and installation procedure a bit. 
<P>Having introduced a number of changes to the workman sources, Kscd is now 
for the most common platform, a Linux with an IDE cdrom, a faster, more 
responsive player, than any other player I know of under Unix and Windows 95. 
Incidentally, Kscd is also the first player under Unix which doesn't hang my 
personal cdrom drive on exit. 
<P>
<P><B>BTW:</B> Kscd stands for "The KDE Project's small/simple CD player".

<P>
<P>I hope you will enjoy this cd-player,
