- Use QBoxLayout Class or libkresize???

For V0.45
- Cleanup code, create a class KMedia:
  - k->play(media)
  - k->stop(media)
  - k->pause(media)
  - ...

For V0.6
- Major protocol revision: Message passing, TCP, net capabilities

For V0.7
- Master must have the ability to reconnect to existing connections
- Master must have the ability to find dead connections (Timeout).
  The same goes for connections, that are not getting built
  at all, because the slave does not show up (No change in
  STAT chunk done by slave). Explanation: The slave may not
  show up because of different reasons. Memory allocation failed,
  config file missing or because the connection library could not
  connect the slave. Several, much more esoteric reasons, can be
  constructed easily. This is left as exercise to the reader. ;-)


For V0.8
- Implement the directed text exchange protocol (Slave ---> Master).

For V0.9
- Make it possible to make entrys into kpanel (play, forward, next track,
  ...) ??? Could be simply implemented as mini-programs. Then create a
  *.kdelnk for each button/program.


For V1.0 or later
- Special configuration data, such as sidplay filter settings could be
  setup by an external program. This is to be called by the slave (or
  the master???), again with a -media option. The slave creates during
  his initialization phase a new chunk, e.g. MdCh_SidFilterSettings.
