This is Tuukka Toivonen's program TiMidity for playing midi files on a pcm
device such as Linux /dev/dsp0 or Sun's /dev/audio (see README.tim).  You need
patch files to use it (see below).  There are several user interfaces provided
for, including a "dumb" command line version and a KDE version, done by Bernd
Wuebben (see below).  The patches can be GUS, i.e. Gravis/Forte, type files,
Gravis InterWave sound fonts, or AWE sbk/sf2 sound fonts.  The InterWave font
support was done by me (Greg Lee) and the AWE support was done by Takashi Iwai
(see README.sf2).


KMidi 0.4
=========

New:

     o timidity is back (use Makefile.tim; see "further notes" below)
     o support for GUS InterWave fonts (.fff/.dat files)
     o multiple AWE soundfonts (.sf2 files)
     o support for stereo or linked instruments in sound fonts
     o strict checking of patch declarations for soundfonts
       (no need to use "order" or "font" statements in cfg files)
     o sbk2cfg utility constructs cfg files for AWE soundfonts
     o use patches in bank 8, etc. (bugfix)
     o buffered output to /dev/dsp0 (Linux/FreeBSD) or /dev/audio (Sun)
     o select patch set from command line with "-#<n>"
     o use experimental cutoff filters with "-q"

     o Linux
     o FreeBSD
     o DEC OSF/1
     o HP_UX

KMidi 0.2

This is the first public release of KMidi a midi to
wav player/converter. 

If you have  already given up on midi on Linux/Unix try this! Without
expensive hard-ware such as a Gravis-Ultra sound or Sound-Blaster AWE 64
you will get fantastic sound comparable to what you get with the above
mentioned hard-ware. FOR FREE!

The catch:

a) KMidi will use your CPU time: anywhere from 10 to 90% on my Pentium 120
   at 32000 Hz. Typically about 30%, but it depends on the particular midi 
   played. If you have a weaker machine, simply use the commandline options to
   reduce the sample frequency. You should be able to get very decent
   sound even on a 486 without straining your CPU.

b) You need the sound patches. You can get a full set of general midi
   sound patches  at any  ultra sound archive. Typical storage requirements
   around 10 megs. 

Belive me for the sound you are going to get this is a small price to pay!

KMidi uses Tuukka Toivonen's  timidity 0.2i engine 
Copyright (C) 1995 Tuukka Toivonen <toivonen@clinet.fi>  
together with Takashi Iwai latest  sound font patches 
( This means you can also use sound fonts with KMidi)

Where to get patches:
(see also the html documentation)

Check out the timidiy home-page (see below) which has a number of links and 
recommendations. Patches can also be found packaged as deb or rpm modules in 
the Redhat and Debian  contribution directories. 

TimidityPage:
http://www.clinet.fi/~toivonen/timidity/

Takahis's Page:
http://bahamut.mm.t.u-tokyo.ac.jp/~iwai/midi.html#TiMidity

I realize this is a rough release, and I am sure that if you try
hard enough you will be able to get KMidi to crash, but I think
KMidi is already more than usable and will hopefull give you hours
of fun. Rememeber Midi files are typically around 50k or leas and
are therefore so easily downloaded that you will never run out of great midi's
to play.

TODO:

o Make the myriad of command line options available through a configuration
  dialog.
o Elaborate visual display of notes played ( This one is going to be FUN!!!)

further notes (where to put them?) --gl
---------------------------------------------------------------

Compiling the command line version of TiMidity can be done, under Linux, by
saying:

	% make clean
	% make -f Makefile.tim
	% make -f Makefile.tim install.lib

The executable will be "timidity". This should also work on Sunos.  I
haven't tried other systems.  For details, see INSTALL.tim and Makefile.tim.
This uses /usr/local/lib/timidity as the config directory.  If you want
a single directory for cfg files, used by both kmidi and timidity, change
the definition of TIMID_DIR in Makefile.tim and/or in config.h.


----------------------------------------------------------------

Obtaining patch files:

     A. GUS .pat files.  See the FAQ and Bernd's .html doc.  Sets of GUS
	patches that were mainly derived from the commercial Gravis/Forte
	ones have become hard to find.

     B. IW sound fonts.  There was a free trial version of the Utopia font
	available for a while (with some stereo patches), but the trial
	version has been withdrawn and now one has to pay $33 for a cd.
	(See http://sdc.wtm.tudelft.nl/utopia/)  If I had them anymore, the
	trial version files would be (after unpacking):

-rw-r--r--   1 root     root        50631 Mar 31 17:08 utop_dm.fff
-rw-r--r--   1 root     root        44295 Mar 31 17:08 utop_ds.fff
-rw-r--r--   1 root     root     41685764 Mar 31 18:37 utop_im.dat
-rw-r--r--   1 root     root        42407 Mar 31 17:08 utop_im.fff
-rw-r--r--   1 root     root      9679116 Mar 25 14:11 utop_is.dat
-rw-r--r--   1 root     root         7501 Mar 31 17:08 utop_is.fff
-rw-r--r--   1 root     root     17368442 Mar 31 17:43 utopia_d.dat

	A sort of precursor to Utopia done by Kevin Boyle was still freely
	available, last time I checked, on various ftp sites:

-rw-r--r--   1 root     root      9727328 Apr  2 18:25 megadrum.dat
-rw-r--r--   1 root     root        32296 Apr  2 17:34 megadrum.fff
-rw-r--r--   1 root     root     18834162 Apr  3 04:13 megainst.dat
-rw-r--r--   1 root     root        39438 Apr  2 17:34 megainst.fff

	(For a time, at least, I'll keep copies of Megainst on my system:
	ftp://moore5651.lll.hawaii.edu/pub/music .)

     C. AWE sound fonts.  At http://soback.kornet.nm.kr/~chaos/sbawe32/sbawe32.htm
	you can get (as self-unpacking .exe's):

-rw-r--r--   1 root     root     12323512 May 19 01:30 chaos12m.sf2
-rw-r--r--   1 root     root      8624378 May 19 01:32 chaos8m.sf2

	There are others at ftp://lysator.liu.se/pub/awe32/soundfonts .

-------------------------------------------------------------------

Using patch files requires setting up .cfg files:

     A. See the other docs for GUS .pat files -- there are example .cfg files.
     B. IW sound fonts need .cfg setups just like GUS patches, except that
	 i. drum/bank statements must be followed by "fff" (e.g., bank 0 fff),
	ii. after the various patches are named, say: fff <basename of font>
	    (e.g., fff megainst).  This loads the font.
	See the example files megainst and megadrum.  You can use several
	IW fonts.
     C. AWE sound fonts are similar to IW fonts, except use the keyword "sbk"
	instead of "fff".  After the patches have been named, say:
	sbk <filename of sf2/sbk font>.  Alternatively, say:
	soundfont <filename>.

The banks/drumsets and names of patches must be given, since those that are not
declared will not be loaded from files (GUS patch files or sound fonts) even
though the patches are available.  This way it's easy to exclude certain
patches from a sound font so as to load better ones from a subseqently loaded
font.  Just don't declare them before you've asked to load the font.

When the same patch of the same bank or drumset is declared more than once,
only the first declaration counts.  So put your best fonts first.

There is a utility sbk2cfg to construct a cfg file for a sbk/sf2 sound font,
which spits out all the patches that are present in the font.  Also, I've
included sample cfg files for chaos8m.sf2 and chaos12m.sf2.

If you have several patch sets and you've set up timidity.cfg appropriately,
you can select among them with the command line switch "-#<n>".  If a "source"
statement in a cfg file is preceded, e.g., by a line "if 2", then the
"source" statement will be skipped over unless "-#2" was given on the
command line.  A line "else" will cause the next "source" statement to
be skipped if any non-zero n was requested by "-#<n>".

----------------------------------------------

I'm sorry my part of this document isn't more coherent and comprehensive.  For
more information you'll just have to browse through the various other files
here, or even read the source.  If I were to list known bugs and deficiences of
this version, it would just tire you out reading through it all.
