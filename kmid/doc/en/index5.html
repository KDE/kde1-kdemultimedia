<P>
I will include some tips so that you can take fully advantage from all the features
 of KMid :
<BR><STRONG>Opening files</STRONG>
<BR>I always keep a KDE desktop with a KFM window in my root midi directory,
 and KMid in this desktop (if playing midi file) or sticky (if playing karaoke :-))
 this way, when the active collection finishes, or I want to play some file, 
 I just go to the KFM window, select the desired files and make drag & drop to
 the KMid's window .
<BR>Suppose that you want to play some midi files, but don't want to add
 them to any collection, well, just turn off the 'AutoAdd to Collection' option
 in the 'Collections' menu, and open the files, they will be added to the
 Temporary Collection .
<BR><STRONG>Another method to create a new Collection</STRONG>
<BR>Suppose that you have midi files A.mid , B.mid and C.mid . At first you
 only want to play the first midi file, so you unselect 'AutoAdd' and open
 A.mid . You get then a Temporary Collection with only one midi file .
<BR>Then you decide to play also B and C, and make a collection with all them,
 what do you do ?
<BR>Easy, select 'AutoAdd' and open B.mid and C.mid (by any of the multiple
 methods), they will be automatically added to the Temporary Collection, that
 will then have A.mid, B.mid and C.mid . At this point, you can open the
 'Organize Collections' dialog, select the Temporary Collection, and click
 on the 'Copy' button, enter the name of the new collection, and you are done .
 You already have a new collection, which holds the A,B and C midi files, and
 that is not deleted when you close KMid .

KMid has been made by Antonio Larrosa Jimenez, in Malaga (Spain) .
 I am a student of Mathematics at the University of Malaga, I am currently
 doing the second course, and orienting to the theorical side of Mathematics
 as well as the practical/physics side . My hobbies include : Programming,
 collecting midi files, playing music and proving theorems :-) .
<BR>In my University, students must take subjects from other careers, and so
 I'm also becoming interested in Computer Aided Diagnostics, but I don't
 know too much about it at this time .
</P>
<P>
If you want to know where to download midi/karaoke files, you have any question,
 a bug to report, an idea or a feature you'd like to see in KMid or just want
 to make me happy, feel free to send me an email to : <A HREF="antlarr@arrakis.es">antlarr@arrakis.es</A>
<BR>or write to me by snail-mail at :
<BR> Antonio Larrosa Jimenez
<BR> Rio Arnoya 10 5B
<BR> Malaga (Spain)
<BR>You will really make me happy if you send me a postcard from where you live,
 or a midi/karaoke file from a local music group of your country . Everyone
 who sends me a postcard or a midi file will have his/her name in the Hall of
 KMid's friends of this file (provided they don't oppose to this) . Please
 contact me before sending me any midi files because I may have it already .
